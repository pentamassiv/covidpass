# covidpass (WIP)
This application can store and validate vaccination certificates from the EU. It's optimized to run on the Pinephone but it should run on any device running Linux.

## TODO
- [ ] Write the GUI
- [ ] Not only validate certificates but also check the business rules of countries (see https://github.com/rust-italia/dgc/issues/19)
- [ ] Allow scanning QR codes to add certificates
